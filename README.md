Hi, my name is Andr√© Ribeiro. I was born in Oliveira do Hospital, a litle city in center of Portugal.
I have a Bsc degree on Civil Protection (or Emergency Management if you prefere) and a Master degree on Environmental Risks and Impacts Monitoring. 
I am about ten years in work market, doing things completly diferent of my formation. 
As I'm tired of doing this type of work, completely mechanized and without intellectual stimulation, I decided to start learning some different things to see if I can change my work area.
Here in Portugal, wages are low and taking a new higher education course comes out of the budget. My solution is to make Mooc's and learn to program.
I really like Science, and I want to develop skills in Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning and Data Science.
In the future I would like to go back to school, but for that I need a better salary.
I would like to study in the health area and then add the Machine Learning knowledge that I will acquire to help saving lifes.
I am available to receive your support and help in this journey, as well as available to collaborate in works or work in this area but, I still being "junior".
At this point, the important thing is to acquire knowledge.
At the same time, I'm doing the training curriculum at freecodeCamp, doing python training at Kaggle and learning C# at Microsoft Learn (by now). 
If you want to share ideas, knowledge, projects, my contacts are available in my profile.
My LinkedIn profile is also available and it is the social network that I use the most since February 2023.
By the way, I started learning at CodeCademy in June of 2024 and I am enrolled to severel career paths courses related to Data Science.

Thank you. :D
